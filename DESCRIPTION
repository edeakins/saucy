Description: Many computational tools have recently begun to benefit from the use of 
    the symmetry inherent in the tasks they solve, and use general-purpose graph symmetry 
    tools to uncover this symmetry. Common applications include organic chemistry, 
    constraint solvers, logistics, optimization, bio-informatics, and finite group theory. 
    However, older symmetry-finding tools often suffer quadratic runtime (or worse!) in 
    the number of symmetries explicitly returned and are therefore of limited use on very 
    large, sparse, symmetric graphs. Over the last 10+ years, we developed a symmetry-
    discovery algorithm which exploits the sparsity present not only in the input but also 
    the output, i.e., the symmetry generators themselves. By avoiding quadratic runtime on 
    large graphs, it improved state-of-the-art runtimes from several days to less than a 
    second. Recent improvements to our algorithm include additional pruning that quickly 
    solves the hard Miyazaki graphs.
